The purpose of this server will be to connect players to a multiplayer game application. I play to use  sockets to create real time communication for possible chat feature but mainly the players plays

The game can feature an unlimited players maybe i'll cap it off some where but the data base will authorize users via Auth 0. I want to use google and maybe facebook too. 

Login the user in and keep track if they lose connection for a second or maybe accidentally close browser I want them to be able to come back into it. mainly the server will serve the purpose of allowing everyone to see the decesions the user made.
